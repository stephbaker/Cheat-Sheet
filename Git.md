# Github
## Vacabulary
- *commit:* kind of like a giant copy and paste (though to keep it light it can commit only a certain set of changes from one version to the next) commits maintain a history
- *branches:* "I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits." Logically divide work than having big braches.
- *merging:* branch off, devolop a new feature, and combine it back in
- *rebasing:* takes a set of commits, "copies" then, and plops them down somewhere
- *HEAD:* symbolic name for the current checked out commit

### Pathways 
1. "git commit" (commit main line)
2. "git checkout -b [branch]; git commit" (create branche, put us on new branche and then commit changes)
3. "git merge [branch]" creating a commit with 2 parents
4. "git rebase [where]" adds the selected branch to the where
